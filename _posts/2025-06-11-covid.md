My family and I were never quarantined due to COVID-19, nor did we suffer from any severe aftereffects of infection.

What affected me the most was not the virus itself, but the pandemic control policies during that time. They forced me to seriously consider how to prepare for the next challenge—whether another epidemic or even a war.

The first time I truly felt the terror of pandemic policies was in the summer of 2021 during the outbreak at Nanjing Lukou Airport. After the outbreak, our residential compound, which houses thousands of people, began mandatory nucleic acid testing for all residents. Everyone was crammed into a single location to queue for testing. The crowding was so extreme that people had to form human chains to avoid being pushed out. At that time, there were no markings to enforce one-meter social distancing. A fight even broke out due to the overcrowding. It was obvious that no one was worried about the virus itself—no one feared infection. Everyone was simply desperate to get tested and be done with it. Initially, people who had been to Lukou Airport and those who hadn’t were put in two separate lines, but the lines were adjacent. Only after complaints were raised did they separate the two lines further.

In that outbreak, the Vice Premier, known for her iron-fisted pandemic control, arrived in Nanjing. She ordered the immediate relocation and quarantine of tens of thousands of close contacts. The policy was enforced without delay. Hundreds of buses departed without their drivers knowing the destination—no arrangements had yet been made. The drivers were simply told to leave the city and await instructions en route.

It’s easy to imagine that these people couldn’t bring basic necessities. My wife and I were terrified. We bought milk powder, multivitamins, extra toothbrushes and toothpaste online. We packed a suitcase with these items, preparing for the possibility of being suddenly taken into quarantine so we wouldn’t be caught off guard.

At the time, Nanjing University had strict pandemic measures in place and did not allow students to leave campus. However, the teaching and residential areas of the university were separated by a public road. To get from dorms to classrooms or the library, students had to leave the university, cross the road, and re-enter on the other side. As a workaround, the university allowed students to leave campus for up to 30 minutes. If they exceeded this time, their green QR code would turn gray. They would be considered in violation of the rules and barred from re-entry unless they submitted a new application.

One of my graduate students wanted to use that 30-minute window to mail a package. The post office was right outside the gate—plenty of time. Unfortunately, there was a line. He calculated that even with the queue, he’d finish in time. But just as his turn came, the clerk stepped away for a bathroom break, delaying him a few minutes. When he finished and rushed back to the gate, the 30-minute limit had just passed. His green code had turned gray, and he couldn’t re-enter. He had to make multiple phone calls, submit an application, and write a self-criticism. Eventually, a university committee held a meeting and granted re-entry but issued a disciplinary warning. This warning could have a lasting impact on his future—that was its intended deterrent. He wrote a sincere reflection, and as his advisor, I signed it—as if it were my own.

Later, I told some colleagues about this absurd policy. But instead of questioning the policy itself, they criticized my student’s foolishness. Several suggested clever ways he could have avoided punishment—for example, returning to campus 20 minutes in, then leaving again to reset the 30-minute clock. Everyone was focused on how to game the system. No one cared whether the system itself made sense.

There was also a mother whose child, under three years old, tested positive while she tested negative. The policy mandated that positive and negative cases could not be quarantined together. So, her child had to be separated from her. She pleaded with health workers, explaining she was with the child 24/7 and must surely be infected too—only the test didn’t show it yet. But the policy was inflexible: separation was required.

In desperation, she told her child to open his mouth and spit into her mouth, then swallowed the saliva. She asked the health workers, “Now I must be positive, right? Can I stay with my child now?” But in the end, she was still forcibly separated from her child.
