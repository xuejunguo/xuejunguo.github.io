My family and I were never quarantined due to COVID-19, nor did we suffer from any severe aftereffects of infection.

What affected me the most was not the virus itself, but the pandemic control policies during that time. They forced me to seriously consider how to prepare for the next challenge—whether another epidemic or even a war.


On January 9, 2020 at 3:10 PM, I measured an armpit temperature of 39.8°C at the Xianlin Campus Health Clinic of Nanjing University. I receive a flu shot every year and hadn’t had a fever in years.

I already sensed my body temperature was abnormally high. Walking to the clinic was difficult; I could barely make it there. Bloodwork results were largely normal, and the doctor said it was “not too bad,” prescribing antipyretics and antibiotics.

I took fever reducers every four hours. My clothes were soaked with sweat several times a day. By January 12, the fever subsided to 37.2°C, but I developed clusters of blisters around my lips. The doctor diagnosed it as herpes simplex and prescribed Acyclovir and vitamin C. 

I continued to have low-grade fever. On January 19, my temperature was 37.7°C at night; on January 20, it was 37.8°C. Concerned about the persistent fever, I went to Taikang Gulou Hospital (Xianlin) that afternoon.

By then, the atmosphere at the hospital was already tense. It felt like a war zone. When I walked into the lobby, the first thing the triage nurse asked me was, “Do you have a fever?” I said yes. She immediately became alarmed, handed me a mask, and asked, “Have you been to Wuhan? Have you had contact with anyone from Wuhan?” I said no, and she relaxed a little. But as a university professor facing over 100 students every day, I couldn’t possibly know whether any of them had traveled to Wuhan.

After hearing my symptoms, the doctor suspected it was more than just a common cold. She ordered blood tests, C-reactive protein, influenza A and B antigen tests, and a chest CT scan. All results were normal.

I requested a test for COVID-19, but the doctor refused. She explained that only patients with known exposure to Wuhan qualified for testing. Since I reported no such contact, I didn’t meet the criteria. In the end, she diagnosed it as a regular cold and wanted to prescribe Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional Chinese medicine. I refused. I knew it was ineffective. I still remember her saying, “It’s actually a good medicine.” I simply smiled. The manufacturer did make billions in profit in the years that followed. I left the hospital without taking any medication. Fortunately, I gradually recovered and never had a fever again.

That year's Lunar New Year, I spent in Nantong. The public mood was already extremely anxious.

On the taxi ride home from Nantong Railway Station, my child coughed once. The driver immediately demanded that we wear masks. I explained that we didn’t have any. He got angry, rolled down all the windows, and drove us through the freezing winter air — it was painfully cold.

At that point, masks were completely sold out. No supermarket, pharmacy, or clinic had them. I did have a few N95 masks I had purchased earlier for pollen allergies, but the supply was very limited and had to be reused many times.

Later, I saw households hanging numerous washed masks outside to dry — everyone was reusing theirs.

Eventually, I ordered some thin, low-quality Indian masks from eBay. They weren’t very protective, but they became our passport for daily life. Without masks, even simple activities became difficult.

Later I realized: Even billionaires reused disposable masks.


The first time I truly felt the terror of pandemic policies was in the summer of 2021 during the outbreak at Nanjing Lukou Airport. After the outbreak, our residential compound, which houses thousands of people, began mandatory nucleic acid testing for all residents. Everyone was crammed into a single location to queue for testing. The crowding was so extreme that people had to form human chains to avoid being pushed out. At that time, there were no markings to enforce one-meter social distancing. A fight even broke out due to the overcrowding. It was obvious that no one was worried about the virus itself—no one feared infection. Everyone was simply desperate to get tested and be done with it. Initially, people who had been to Lukou Airport and those who hadn’t were put in two separate lines, but the lines were adjacent. Only after complaints were raised did they separate the two lines further.

In that outbreak, some official ordered the immediate relocation and quarantine of tens of thousands of close contacts. The policy was enforced without delay. Hundreds of buses departed without their drivers knowing the destination—no arrangements had yet been made. The drivers were simply told to leave the city and await instructions en route.

It’s easy to imagine that these people couldn’t bring basic necessities. My wife and I were terrified. We bought milk powder, multivitamins, extra toothbrushes and toothpaste online. We packed a suitcase with these items, preparing for the possibility of being suddenly taken into quarantine so we wouldn’t be caught off guard.

At the time, Nanjing University had strict pandemic measures in place and did not allow students to leave campus. However, the teaching and residential areas of the university were separated by a public road. To get from dorms to classrooms or the library, students had to leave the university, cross the road, and re-enter on the other side. As a workaround, the university allowed students to leave campus for up to 30 minutes. If they exceeded this time, their green QR code would turn gray. They would be considered in violation of the rules and barred from re-entry unless they submitted a new application.

One of my graduate students wanted to use that 30-minute window to mail a package. The post office was right outside the gate—plenty of time. Unfortunately, there was a line. He calculated that even with the queue, he’d finish in time. But just as his turn came, the clerk stepped away for a bathroom break, delaying him a few minutes. When he finished and rushed back to the gate, the 30-minute limit had just passed. His green code had turned gray, and he couldn’t re-enter. He had to make multiple phone calls, submit an application, and write a self-criticism. Eventually, a university committee held a meeting and granted re-entry but issued a disciplinary warning. This warning could have a lasting impact on his future—that was its intended deterrent. He wrote a sincere reflection, and as his advisor, I signed it—as if it were my own.

Later, I told some colleagues about this absurd policy. But instead of questioning the policy itself, they criticized my student’s foolishness. Several suggested clever ways he could have avoided punishment—for example, returning to campus 20 minutes in, then leaving again to reset the 30-minute clock. Everyone was focused on how to game the system. No one cared whether the system itself made sense.

There was also a mother whose child, under three years old, tested positive while she tested negative. The policy mandated that positive and negative cases could not be quarantined together. So, her child had to be separated from her. She pleaded with health workers, explaining she was with the child 24/7 and must surely be infected too—only the test didn’t show it yet. But the policy was inflexible: separation was required.

In desperation, she told her child to open his mouth and spit into her mouth, then swallowed the saliva. She asked the health workers, “Now I must be positive, right? Can I stay with my child now?” But in the end, she was still forcibly separated from her child.

On January 1, 2022, a woman who was eight months pregnant in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, experienced abdominal pain and was taken to Xi’an Gaoxin Hospital. However, she was not admitted due to lacking a valid COVID test. According to her family’s account on social media, she waited outside the hospital for about two hours (from a bit past 8 p.m. to over 10 p.m.), during which time she began bleeding heavily. Tragically, the fetus died in utero.

Earlier, at a hospital in northeastern China, medical staff had treated someone who didn’t yet have a valid COVID test, which later caused a major outbreak. As a result, several people were imprisoned. Fearing similar punishment, the medical staff in Xi’an watched helplessly as tragedy unfolded. Under harsh epidemic control policies, even well-meaning people became paralyzed by fear.

Eventually, nearly all Chinese people were infected with COVID. It started in schools. Middle school students, particularly boys, didn’t take it seriously at first. When a few cases appeared in a classroom, some students would enter that classroom, take deep breaths, and boast that they were "breathing in the virus," earning admiration from their peers. When they returned home, they passed the virus on to their parents and grandparents. Within just two weeks, over 90% of China’s population was infected.

I am a university professor, and my son was in middle school at the time. Naturally, we could not escape infection.

On December 19, 2022, I woke up and immediately checked the COVID test result I had taken the day before at the campus clinic. On the 18th, I had developed a sore throat and a cough. Since I had been in close contact with several known positives, I suspected I had caught the virus and got tested that afternoon.

The events of December 17 and 18 were so overwhelming that the night of the 18th, I lay awake, feeling like those two days had stretched into years. I didn't want to say anything about what happened on December 17 and 18. 

When I saw a negative result on the morning of the 19th, I was relieved—but only for a few seconds. I realized I had a fever. My temperature was 38°C. I went to the university clinic, where they confirmed my fever (38.2°C) and performed a a COVID-19 antigen test, which came back negative, and my blood oxygen was 100%. While registering my information at the nurse’s station, I suddenly choked up and cried. I had to pause before I could finish filling out the form.

The clinic felt like the end of the world. The young man in front of me couldn’t stand upright. He squatted in line, and when he did try to stand, he swayed like a brittle stalk in the wind. No one helped him. Almost everyone was coughing. A sign on the wall read: "No ibuprofen. No acetaminophen. Only Xiao Chai Hu and Banlangen herbal medicine available." Xiao Chai Hu and Banlangen herbal are traditional chinese herb medicine. Everyone know they are useless and no one wants it. That's why the clinic has plenty of them. 

At that moment, a middle-aged man appeared at the entrance, wearing a mask and looking around. A doctor recognized him and asked, "Do you have a fever? What are you doing here? Go wait in line." The man replied, "I don’t have a fever." The doctor suddenly erupted in rage: "If you don’t want to die, then get the hell out of here! What are you doing wandering around here? Do you know what this place is? Get out!" Then the doctor started yelling and swearing. The man said nothing and quickly disappeared. Everyone—literally everyone—remained expressionless. No one reacted. Normally, such a scene would prompt people to comment or even laugh, but not that day. It was as if no one had seen it. The doctor resumed his work as if nothing had happened. It truly felt like the end of the world, where everyone had turned into zombies.

After finishing my registration, I asked the nurse what I should do next. She told me to go stand in line to see a doctor. I asked what medications they might prescribe. She replied, "I don’t know." I told her, "I still have two boxes of ibuprofen at home." She said, "Then you should go home. We don’t have medicine that good here." So I went home. By that afternoon, my fever had risen above 39°C.


There were five of us living together in a small apartment.   Although we tried everything we could to avoid cross-infection, it was inevitable — all five of us eventually developed fevers, one after another.  
We tested ourselves with at-home antigen kits: all positive.  

While I had a fever, I kept having strange dreams.   It felt like I was trapped in a fragmented world.  
I would drift in and out of sleep, and each dream felt like another sliver of that broken world.

I talked with colleagues in our WeChat group, and everyone seemed to have different symptoms.  
Some had sore throats so severe they described them as being slashed by knives — they called this variant the “razor throat.”   Others, oddly, found their appetite greatly increased after fever — that was dubbed the “hungry strain.”   Many elderly people died.   The university’s bulletin boards gradually filled with death notices.  
Eventually, there was no space left to post new ones, so they were simply pasted over the old ones.

Most young people, however, recovered quickly — teenagers even faster.   I, too, recovered quickly, but my resting heart rate remained unusually high.  It used to be 62.  Even several weeks after the infection, it was still in the 80s.  A colleague of mine noticed the veins near his temples were bulging, like he had just finished a marathon.

Ironically, the official test results on my Alipay health app always showed “negative,” and my QR code remained green.  Yet, on December 20, 2021, at 11:52 PM, I received a text message:

> “[Qixia District Pandemic Prevention Office] Dear citizen: Your most recent COVID nucleic acid test result is positive.  
> In accordance with the latest epidemic prevention policies, please report to your local community by phone and self-isolate at home for at least 7 days.  
> Do not go out unless necessary.  
> If you violate prevention regulations and cause the virus to spread, you will bear legal responsibility.”

That moment shattered my faith.  I had always trusted the data released by the government.  I read every report.  
I believed in my country, in my government.

That day, the official report claimed that Jiangsu Province had only 3 new infections.  But in my apartment alone, 5 people were sick.  Jiangsu has over 84 million people.  Anyone could see the absurdity of that lie.

Someone was shamelessly broadcasting false infection numbers, knowing that every household could debunk them with their own experience.  It knew we knew, and still it lied.  They didn't even have the courage to mark my Alipay code red — they only dared send me a text message, followed by a legal threat.

Earlier, on November 21, 2022, I also received this text:

> “[Jianye District Government, Nanjing] Dear citizen:  
> Based on big data analysis, you may have crossed paths with a COVID-positive case.  
> If you traveled near Jiqingmen Street to Xianmen between 07:40–08:15, and again between 17:45–18:20, please report to your community immediately.  
> Perform self-health monitoring and complete five nucleic acid tests over seven days.  
> Do not go out or attend group activities.  
> If you develop fever or cough symptoms, visit a fever clinic.  
> Failure to comply will result in legal consequences.”

This was utterly absurd.  
I had only driven through that area, windows closed.  
Because my car had followed a route once taken by an infected person, I was ordered to isolate and undergo five tests in seven days.


Of course, I didn’t self-isolate.  I’m a teacher — I have a duty to show up and teach my students.  
Besides, it was obvious to anyone: I had simply driven past a location that a COVID-positive person had once visited. I had zero real risk of infection.

That’s when a new term was invented: **"spatial-temporal companion"**.  If someone had been to a certain place within 14 days and your path happened to cross theirs during that time, you could be labeled a spatial-temporal companion.  Telecom companies used SIM card location data to determine whether you had been in proximity and whether you needed to isolate for 14 days.

Someone wrote a satirical poem about it:

> I walked the path you once passed through —  
> Does that count as an encounter?  
> I breathed the wind you once exhaled —  
> Does that count as an embrace?  
> Though we never brushed shoulders within 800 meters,  
> You ask me for 14 days of faithful waiting.

At the time, cities across China strictly monitored travelers from other regions.  
One county even **dug up the roads** to block outsiders from entering.

This wasn't the first time something absurd had happened.  Back in 2003 during the SARS outbreak, a rumor spread in my hometown that I had "fled from Beijing" to hide out in Shandong.   Village officials panicked.  
They came to my parents’ home with several people and searched everywhere, trying to drag me out and bring me to justice.  The truth was — I was in Italy at the time.  When I heard what had happened, I was furious.

During the pandemic, Nanjing issued a rule:  If your SIM card's location data showed you had been to another city, your **QR code would change color**.  You could even lose your right to enter vegetable markets and buy meat.

In 2022, Nanjing introduced a rule: the moment your SIM-card location showed that you had left the city, your health QR code would change color. Once that happened, you could even lose the right to enter a wet market to buy vegetables or meat.

My wife’s university has a branch campus in Changzhou. Whenever she had to teach there, her green code could easily turn yellow, stripping her of many basic rights until she could test again and regain a green code. This also created trouble for our child: every morning we had to upload the nucleic-acid test results and the past 14-day travel history for every member of our household to the parents’ chat group. If any place you had passed through during those 14 days was later labeled a “risk area,” you were in trouble—even if the area was only added to the list more than ten days after you had left it. Our child could end up barred from school.

One colleague got into serious trouble simply because he drove his electric car off the highway to a nearby charging station. Normally, a brief stop would not appear in your 14-day travel log. But because he exited the expressway and later re-entered, the highway system registered him as having entered another city. On his way back to Nanjing he was stopped by traffic police at the tollgate. His code turned yellow, and he was ordered to a designated testing site. Only after several consecutive days of negative tests could he apply to have his code turned green again. During that time, except for going to the test site, he could hardly move around at all.

After studying the rules carefully, I came up with a solution:   Just before  leaving Nanjing, my wife removed the SIM card from her phone.  Then she wrapped both the phone and SIM card **in multiple layers of aluminum foil**, completely shielding it from location signals. When she returned to Nanjing, she unwrapped everything and reinserted the SIM card.  The phone resumed normal function — and no one knew she had ever left the city and came back. She was able to do this because she was taking the university shuttle bus. She only needed to swipe her campus card to board and didn’t need to use her phone.  She took the school bus from one campus to another, taught her class, and then took the school bus back. She was able to go through the whole process without using her phone at all.
   

My son had a smartwatch with a SIM card that I had purchased from JD.com. The number was registered under Beijing Unicom. Even though my son had always been in Nanjing, the local telecom system detected the SIM card as an “out-of-town” number. As a result, he was flagged as a potential case from Beijing.

He began receiving alarming text messages from the Nanjing health authorities, instructing him to get a COVID test immediately. The tone of these messages was intimidating — almost designed to terrify. Sometimes he even received phone calls.

The harassment became overwhelming. We contacted the Qixia District pandemic prevention office several times. Strangely, they told us we could ignore the warnings. But the threatening messages kept coming anyway, with no sign of stopping.
